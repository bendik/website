<h1>Hypercore for Developers</h1>

<p>
  The Hypercore Protocol is a peer-to-peer network for:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Connecting devices,</li>
  <li>Streaming data,</li>
  <li>Sharing files and databases, and</li>
  <li>Building applications.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Hypercore is inspired by BitTorrent.
  It creates networked datasets which users can seed in a distributed mesh.
  Hypercore includes a variety of tools for connecting devices and is built on a <a href="<%= rootPath %>guides/dev/" title="Developers">very modular API</a> for building custom programs.
</p>

<% include /stack-diagram %>

<p>
  The Hypercore Protocol is designed with flexibility and modularity in mind.
  Our modules can be viewed as "Lego blocks" for building P2P applications: you're free to pick and choose the tools you need. 
</p>

<p>
  Modularity affords you the ability to tweak and customize, gradually honing in on the right set of components and configurations for your use-case.
</p>

<p>
  But exploring the space of options can be daunting, especially if you're new to the P2P world. If you're looking for an opinionated combination of modules that "just work", our Hyperspace server is the way to go.
</p>


<h2>Walkthroughs</h2>

<p>
    Our first two walkthrough tracks will explore the two columns of the stack diagram above.
</p>

<p>
    Either track will prepare you for working with Hyperdrives and Hyperbees
</p>

<h3>Low-Level Track</h3>

<p>
  The Hypercore Protocol is inspired by BitTorrent.
  It creates networked datasets which users can seed in a distributed mesh.
  It also includes a variety of tools for connecting devices, streaming data, and running services.
</p>

<p>
  To get started, choose how you want to use Hypercore:

<p>
  <strong>Hyperspace</strong> is a batteries-included daemon that bundles together many of our core modules, handling many low-level details for you.
  99% of the time, it's what you'll want to use.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Standalone modules</strong> afford you the ability to tweak and customize, gradually honing in on the right set of components and configurations for your use-case.
  This is slightly more advanced, but may fit your needs more closely depending on what you're building.
</p>

<h2>Architectural Overview</h2>

<% include /stack-diagram %>

<p>
  The Hypercore Protocol is designed with flexibility and modularity in mind.
  The modules can be viewed as "Lego blocks" for building P2P applications: you're free to pick and choose the tools you need.

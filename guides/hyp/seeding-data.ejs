<p>
  When you create a hyperdrive, it will automatically start seeding in the background.
</p>

<div class="info-aside">
  "Seeding" means hosting the Hyperdrive's data on the network.
  Anybody can seed a hyperdrive &mdash; not just the original author.
  The more seeders are online, the faster a drive will download.
</div>

<p>
  You can see what drives you're seeding with the info command.
</p>

<div class="bash">hyp info</div>

<p>
  You can start seeding a hyperdrive created by someone else using the seed command:
</p>

<div class="bash">hyp seed hyper://1234â€¦af</div>

<p>
  Use "unseed" to stop seeding.
